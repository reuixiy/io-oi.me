All organizations have to look inside to make sure they do what they do as well as they can, they also need to look outside to see what’s going on in the market, what competitors are doing, and all the rest of it. As organizations become more powerful more significant in terms of the fact that they are the precursor of that, they stop looking out, and that’s when they start believing their own hype. They all say, well we are number one therefore we’re safe. No I’m sorry the message is if you’re number one the only way is down, and that’s what happens.

When Steve Jobs came back to Apple, Apple changed its name from Apple Computer Company to simply Apple Incorporated. And what Steve Jobs did was to walk in the door and say we are no longer a computer platform company, we have lost that battle so just forget it. We’re a consumer company and I want to stop every single thing that’s not aimed at consumers. People were astounded. That focus is what caused Apple to turn around.

There are some intriguing parallels between business and nature. You essentially have to keep evolving in order to keep alive.

大眾照片市場的變化：底片、數碼相機、智能手機，柯達的轉型失敗、奧林巴斯的財務造假醜聞、富士的適應競爭生存，也提及了喬布斯領導的蘋果的積極創新。商業市場就像我們生存的自然環境，一直都在不斷變化，作為箇體與企業，唯有不斷突變不斷適應不斷競爭，才能長久生存生長。作為在此客觀環境演化而來的智能意識，也唯有不斷積極挑戰，才能獲得生命自尊的滿意。

Everything is a fight. We fight on the market with our competitors, the change of technology is also a fight. We had to fight against the constraints of technological convention. Life is the fighting of many battles.

「生於憂患，死於安樂。」唯有不斷競爭創新，才能贏得滿意勝利。現代世界相對文明，適者生存不再等同弱肉強食，但唯有充分的競爭意識，才能贏得這場開放的競技運動。正如古希臘思想中的阿睿提（[Arete](https://reuixiy.notion.site/168c9131ed4f80d2b163de946715ab6b)），即追求卓越，「充分發揮箇人潛力的行為。卓越者是最有效的，他們使用所有的能力——力量、勇敢和智慧——來取得真正的成果。」——也即我們生命存在之魅力所在。[*](https://reuixiy.notion.site/24bc9131ed4f806ab22cd19358ad7d03)
